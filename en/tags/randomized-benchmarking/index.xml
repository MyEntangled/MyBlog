      <description>Knowing the underpinnings of standard randomized benchmarking addressed in the last part, we first begin with the standard protocol. Standard RB is used to assess the error rate over gates of Clifford group with an assumption that these gates have the same error rate. After that, another improvement of the technique will be introduced, namely Interleaved Randomized Benchmarking. The upgraded version was proposed to not to investigate the Clifford group as a whole, but restricted to one single kind of Clifford gate of our choice.</description>

      <description>As you can see in the cover figure, quantum computing is just at the onset of its journey. There are tons of work to do before we can move to the next stage of quantum computing, quantum supremacy. Two pivotal constraints to the realization of any useful quantum processor are decoherence and the high error rate of quantum operators, or quantum gates experimentally. It&amp;rsquo;s been suggested that the probability of error per unitary gate should be less than $10^{-2}$ (better $10^{-4}$) for the outcome to be reliable.</description>
