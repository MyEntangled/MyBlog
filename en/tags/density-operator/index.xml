      <description>In this text I&amp;rsquo;ll do some review on the definition of quantum state and quantum measurement, which was introduced here, and reasonably expand the notions into the most general instances of quantum bits.
Review Given a state $$|\psi\rangle = \sum_i \alpha_i |\varphi_i \rangle,$$ it&amp;rsquo;s possible to perform a Von Neumann measurement on the state&amp;rsquo;s space $\mathscr{H}$ with respect to the orthonormal basis $B = \{|\varphi_i \rangle\}$. The output would be a label $i$ with corresponding probability $|\alpha_i|^2$ and the system left in state $|\varphi_i\rangle$.</description>

      <description>In the article of Bernsterin-Vazirani implementation, I&amp;rsquo;ve addressed one of the most crucial challenges of quantum computing. The field is yet to flourish because quantum gates aren&amp;rsquo;t constructed to be good enough. One major difference of quantum gates versus classical counterparts is that quantum gates have to be reversible, which means we can retrieve a prior state of a qubit without loss of information. Scientists are now on their way to establish a proper scheme for building decent quantum gates.</description>
