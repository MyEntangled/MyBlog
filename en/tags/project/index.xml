      <description>Because the Deutsch algorithm is just a simple instance of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm where $n=2$, we&amp;rsquo;ll only discuss how to implement the general one. Let&amp;rsquo;s go.
Difficulty of reconstructing gates from matrices This is the first time we encounter a so-called black-box function in an algorithm. It&amp;rsquo;s called a black box since we don&amp;rsquo;t how it calculate the output from the input, but we do know the output it returns.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s implement and verify the teleporation protocol following the procedure we discussed throughout previous parts.
First we need to create an arbitrary quantum state. Trong has been curious about the combined effect of rotation gates about the x, y, and z axes. So, he decides to apply three distinct rotation gates, each as a rotation of 60 degrees around one coordinate axis acting on a qubit currently in the Hadamard state $|-\rangle$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement to cheat the Reality</title>

      <description>Quantum entanglement Have you ever thought of a situation when the happening of an event in an isolated environment dictates the result of another event also in an isolated environment with no communication allowed? That sounds infeasible in our view of reality, except that these two separated events share a somewhat telepathic power. Yes, this telepathy really happens in the realm of quantum entanglement. The phenomenon can be simplified that the result of the first measurement reveals information about the result of the second measurement despite an absolute separation and no communication setting.</description>
