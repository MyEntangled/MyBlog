      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s implement and verify the teleporation protocol following the procedure we discussed throughout previous parts.
First we need to create an arbitrary quantum state. Trong has been curious about the combined effect of rotation gates about the x, y, and z axes. So, he decides to apply three distinct rotation gates, each as a rotation of 60 degrees around one coordinate axis acting on a qubit currently in the Hadamard state $|-\rangle$.</description>

      <description>Quantum entanglement Have you ever thought of a situation when the happening of an event in an isolated environment dictates the result of another event also in an isolated environment with no communication allowed? That sounds infeasible in our view of reality, except that these two separated events share a somewhat telepathic power. Yes, this telepathy really happens in the realm of quantum entanglement. The phenomenon can be simplified that the result of the first measurement reveals information about the result of the second measurement despite an absolute separation and no communication setting.</description>

      <description>Quantum entanglement is, by definition, a phenomenon that the combined state of a set of qubits cannot be described as a product of the states of each qubit of that set, which also means the entangled state contains hidden information that one cannot reveal through examining separate qubits. In this text, I&amp;rsquo;m going to introduce and discuss several aspects of this spectacular phenomenon.
Measurement in different bases In previous posts, I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned that a qubit can be in a superposition of its basis states $\left|0\right\rangle$ and $\left|1\right\rangle$ with corresponding complex amplitudes $a_0$ and $a_1$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Operations: Unitary and Reversible Matrices</title>

      <description>In classical computation, there are four basic operations that act on information bits, namely Identity (no operation), Negation (NOT), Conjunction (AND), and Disjunction (OR). All other operations are secondary and built upon these four operations. That being said, with the primary and secondary operations, one is able to perform any calculation in classical fashion. Since every operation can be implemented as a logic gate in the circuit, all calculations come down to a specific sequence of logic gates.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in my previous post, qubits doesn&amp;rsquo;t suffer from the limitation of only being $0$ or $1$. Within this article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about some background knowledge essential for ones who have just stepped into the field like me.
Single Qubit Dirac notation $\left | \cdot \right\rangle$ (pronounced as ket) is adopted to indicate qubit states. The state $\left|\psi\right\rangle$ associated with a qubit can be an arbitrary unit vector in the two-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers.</description>

      <description>You may have heard of quantum information promising many prospects in revolutionizing the future of computers? When I was a high-schooler years ago, I also got amazed by these statements repeated in pop science articles. But to what extent this statement is true? Before we come to a final conclusion, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look on historical milestones of the field.
The duration from the 1900s to 1930s was the golden age of quantum mechanics with many groundbreaking findings that established a concrete theoretical foundation for quantum information.</description>
