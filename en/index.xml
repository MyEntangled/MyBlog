      <description>About me Hi, my name is Entangled, a cat who adopted a boy named Trong Duong. My servant&amp;hellip; I liken&amp;rsquo;t when he laughed watching videos of other cats showing off their cuteness. He love eating like me&amp;hellip; but just a mediocre, troublemaking cook. He&amp;rsquo;s also a textrovert, a word coined to indicate a person who is apparently energetic in a texting conversation but may dumb as a fish in a face-to-face.</description>

      <title>Quantum Teleportation: The Art of transporting the Unknown (Part 2)</title>

      <description>Problem Statement Suppose Trong has just created a wonderful qubit in his lab. He knows his qubit look like $|\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle$ but doesn&amp;rsquo;t know $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Now he wants to transport this qubit to his crush, but they don&amp;rsquo;t have a quantum channel that can help transport quantum information. Of course it&amp;rsquo;s a very bad idea for Trong to try to figure out $\alpha$ and $\beta$ through measurement because if he does so, he&amp;rsquo;ll destroy his qubit but only learn extremely little information about it.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s implement and verify the teleporation protocol following the procedure we discussed throughout previous parts.
First we need to create an arbitrary quantum state. Trong has been curious about the combined effect of rotation gates about the x, y, and z axes. So, he decides to apply three distinct rotation gates, each as a rotation of 60 degrees around one coordinate axis acting on a qubit currently in the Hadamard state $|-\rangle$.</description>

      <description>Here we start exploring a core of Quantum Computing: Quantum Algorithms. Before we dive into the dark and deep pool of such algorithms, it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to get familiar with a fundamental constraint to Quantum Computing. In contrast, I&amp;rsquo;ll also introduce you how powerful qubits get in solving problems through a basic protocol: Quantum Teleportation, the &amp;ldquo;Hello, world!&amp;rdquo; of Quantum Programming.
 No-cloning theorem In terms of computer architechture, it&amp;rsquo;s convenient to copy the state of a bit in order to create a new qubit exactly the same.</description>

      <title>A formal approach to Observables and Measurements</title>

      <description>Throughout previous posts, I&amp;rsquo;ve delivered a way to understand what is a quantum measurement. That way of understanding is simple and may suit our normal intuition, but measurement is a non-trivial physical process and somewhat counter-intuitive for several reasons.
First, a measurement in general results in probabilistic outcomes. No matter how careful you prepare for the measurement procedure, it is inherent that possible outcomes of a measure is distributed according to a certain probability distribution determined by the state space of your quantum system.</description>

      <title>Quantum Search Algorithm</title>

      <description>By examining this operator in the instance of $|\Psi\rangle = \frac{1}{2} \left(|00\rangle +|01\rangle+|10\rangle+|11\rangle \right)$, i.e. the equal superposition of two qubits, and a post-phase-flip state $|k\rangle_2 = \left(a_{00}|00\rangle +a_{01}|01\rangle+a_{10}|10\rangle+a_{11}|11\rangle \right)$, we expect to preview the behavior of this so called phase-shift operator. The general form of this transformation is $\displaystyle{(2 |\Psi\rangle \langle\Psi| - I) |k\rangle_n = 2 |\Psi\rangle \langle\Psi||k\rangle_n - |k\rangle_n}$. For a clear writing, the part before the minus sign will be evaluated first.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement to cheat the Reality</title>

      <description>Quantum entanglement Have you ever thought of a situation when the happening of an event in an isolated environment dictates the result of another event also in an isolated environment with no communication allowed? That sounds infeasible in our view of reality, except that these two separated events share a somewhat telepathic power. Yes, this telepathy really happens in the realm of quantum entanglement. The phenomenon can be simplified that the result of the first measurement reveals information about the result of the second measurement despite an absolute separation and no communication setting.</description>

      <title>Quantum Measurement: Not just 0 and 1</title>

      <description>Quantum entanglement is, by definition, a phenomenon that the combined state of a set of qubits cannot be described as a product of the states of each qubit of that set, which also means the entangled state contains hidden information that one cannot reveal through examining separate qubits. In this text, I&amp;rsquo;m going to introduce and discuss several aspects of this spectacular phenomenon.
Measurement in different bases In previous posts, I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned that a qubit can be in a superposition of its basis states $\left|0\right\rangle$ and $\left|1\right\rangle$ with corresponding complex amplitudes $a_0$ and $a_1$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Operations: Unitary and Reversible Matrices</title>

      <description>In classical computation, there are four basic operations that act on information bits, namely Identity (no operation), Negation (NOT), Conjunction (AND), and Disjunction (OR). All other operations are secondary and built upon these four operations. That being said, with the primary and secondary operations, one is able to perform any calculation in classical fashion. Since every operation can be implemented as a logic gate in the circuit, all calculations come down to a specific sequence of logic gates.</description>

      <title>Qubits: The substitution of bits in quantum scenario</title>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in my previous post, qubits doesn&amp;rsquo;t suffer from the limitation of only being $0$ or $1$. Within this article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about some background knowledge essential for ones who have just stepped into the field like me.
Single Qubit Dirac notation $\left | \cdot \right\rangle$ (pronounced as ket) is adopted to indicate qubit states. The state $\left|\psi\right\rangle$ associated with a qubit can be an arbitrary unit vector in the two-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers.</description>

      <description>You may have heard of quantum information promising many prospects in revolutionizing the future of computers? When I was a high-schooler years ago, I also got amazed by these statements repeated in pop science articles. But to what extent this statement is true? Before we come to a final conclusion, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look on historical milestones of the field.
The duration from the 1900s to 1930s was the golden age of quantum mechanics with many groundbreaking findings that established a concrete theoretical foundation for quantum information.</description>
