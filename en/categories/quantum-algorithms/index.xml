      <description>Knowing the underpinnings of randomized benchmarking addressed in the last part, we first begin with the standard protocol. Standard RB is used to assess the error rate over gates of Clifford group with an assumption that these gates have the same error rate. After that, another improvement of the technique will be introduced, namely Interleaved Randomized Benchmarking. The upgraded version was proposed not to investigate the Clifford group as a whole, but restricted to one single kind of Clifford gate of our choice.</description>

      <description>As you can see in the cover figure, quantum computing is just at the onset of its journey. There are tons of work to do before we can move to the next stage of quantum computing, quantum supremacy. Two pivotal constraints to the realization of any useful quantum processor are decoherence and the high error rate of quantum operators, or quantum gates experimentally. It&amp;rsquo;s been suggested that the probability of error per unitary gate should be less than $10^{-2}$ (better $10^{-4}$) for the outcome to be reliable.</description>

      <description>In the last part of the previous series, Deutsch algorithm, I introduced a manual way to construct the oracle. That oracle must be built from matrix because the oracle function is undeterminate except for the outcome. In Bernsterin-Vazirani problem, the function is, on the other hand, clearly stated: $f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{s}\cdot\mathbf{x}$. So, it&amp;rsquo;s unnecessary to repeat the previous procedure; instead, we&amp;rsquo;ll build the oracle without using matrices by understanding what the function really do.</description>

      <description>Here we stop by Berstein-Vazirani problem that inherents the structure of its predecessor, Deutsch-Jozsa problem, before we can get started with problems and solutions of practical meaning later. Because this problem is similar to the one stated in the last series, we&amp;rsquo;ll get straight to it.
Berstein-Vazirani problem The access for a black-box function $f: \{0,1\}^n \mapsto \{0,1\}$. It&amp;rsquo;s guaranteed that $f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{s}\cdot\mathbf{x}$ (mod $2$) for some secret string $\mathbf{s} \in \{0,1\}^n$.</description>

      <description>Because the Deutsch algorithm is just a simple instance of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm where $n=2$, we&amp;rsquo;ll only discuss how to implement the general one. Let&amp;rsquo;s go.
Difficulty of reconstructing gates from matrices This is the first time we encounter a so-called black-box function in an algorithm. It&amp;rsquo;s called a black box since we don&amp;rsquo;t how it calculate the output from the input, but we do know the output it returns.</description>

      <description>Here we&amp;rsquo;re gonna see the most impressive quantum algorithm in terms of query complexity. The algorithm is an generalization of the original Deutsch algorithm we discussed in the last post. But I want to say that this algorithm may not be as extraordinary as you may think of it. It was created to solve a kind of problem that has zero practical meaning for the purpose of demonstrating how strong quantum computing can reach compared to classical computing.</description>

      <description>I have said something like quantum computing can overpower classical computing several times before. In this series, I&amp;rsquo;m going to showing you a problem with a quantum algorithm that is exponentially faster in terms of complexity than any classical solution. In this text, we&amp;rsquo;re going to explore an essential technique and apply it to solve the simplest version of Deutsch problem.
 Phase kick-back One concept you may encouter numerous times in a Linear Algebra class is eigenvalues and eigenvectors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Teleportation (Part 2): The Art of transporting the Unknown</title>

      <description>Problem Statement Suppose Trong has just created a wonderful qubit in his lab. He knows his qubit look like $|\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle$ but doesn&amp;rsquo;t know $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Now he wants to transport this qubit to his crush, but they don&amp;rsquo;t have a quantum channel that can help transport quantum information. Of course it&amp;rsquo;s a very bad idea for Trong to try to figure out $\alpha$ and $\beta$ through measurement because if he does so, he&amp;rsquo;ll destroy his qubit but only learn extremely little information about it.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s implement and verify the teleporation protocol following the procedure we discussed throughout previous parts.
First we need to create an arbitrary quantum state. Trong has been curious about the combined effect of rotation gates about the x, y, and z axes. So, he decides to apply three distinct rotation gates, each as a rotation of 60 degrees around one coordinate axis acting on a qubit currently in the Hadamard state $|-\rangle$.</description>

      <description>Here we start exploring a core of Quantum Computing: Quantum Algorithms. Before we dive into the dark and deep pool of such algorithms, it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to get familiar with a fundamental constraint to Quantum Computing. In contrast, I&amp;rsquo;ll also introduce you how powerful qubits get in solving problems through a basic protocol: Quantum Teleportation, the &amp;ldquo;Hello, world!&amp;rdquo; of Quantum Programming.
 No-cloning theorem In terms of computer architechture, it&amp;rsquo;s convenient to copy the state of a bit in order to create a new qubit exactly the same.</description>
